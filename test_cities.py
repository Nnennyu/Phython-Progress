#UNIT TEST AND TEST CASES
""" A module unittest from python library is used to verify that one specific aspect of a function's
 behavior is correct. A test case with full coverage includes a full range of unit tests covering
  all the possible ways you can use a function."""

#Exercise 11-1 pg255
"""To write a test case for a function, import the unittest module and the function you want to test. 
Then create a class that inherits from unittest.TestCase, and write a series of methods to test different 
aspects of your functionâ€™s behavior"""
